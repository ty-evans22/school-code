### Com S 319

This was an intro to web development class which taught the basics of using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design and create beautiful and functional websites. We also used libraries such as React to create responsive websites. I took this class the second semester of my senior year as an elective, as although I already had quite a bit of experience with web design (i.e. my capstone project), I wanted to improve my understanding and grow my web development skills even more. This folder only contains the code for the small in-class activies that we completed for this class, as much of the other code I completed was done within an online homework and learning program called ZyBooks. Code for the projects that I completed for this class can be found under other repositories (I don't own the repositories, they are under my partner's GitHub account which should be able to be found through my own as I created various commits to them). None of the code in this folder is very impressive, as each of the in-class assignments were relatively simple. I simply included it to get it off my computer as well as to provide some basic insight into my programming skills.
