How to compile and run:

In order to run the program, navigate to the directory
containing the 'lab4.jar' file in the command line and
execute the following command:

java -jar lab4.jar <value for n>

My program generates a map of size n conforming to the
specifications in the lab, and then runs each of the algos
for k = 3 and k = 4, and outputs the run time for each.

It can output the solution as well by uncommenting the lines
listed as debugging output in the main function of my code.
(Although this requires the jar file to be rebuilt, unless
you just run the program within the IDE)

NOTE: The jar file was compiled with Java 11, so it should
work on most computers with Java installed.
