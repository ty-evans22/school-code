### Com S 321

This class focused on learning about computer architecture and design principles, and most of the code development revolved around an architecture called LEGv8, which
is a far simplified version of ARM (hence the name - arm and leg) and taught me how to think at a very low level of coding. We were also required to write a simple
program in binary as well, but I no longer have that code so it was not included. This was a required class for all Computer Science majors and I found it to be
incredibly useful, and had fun with it as well.
