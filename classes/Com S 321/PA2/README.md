### PA2

This assignment required us to write a disassembler in C++ which took a simple C file and disassembled it into a file containing the corresponding LEGv8 assembly code.
Due to the limitations of LEGv8, I believe this only worked for relatively simple C code, but I could be wrong. Additionally, although it was not required I included a
few lines at the end of my disassembler which could be uncommented and run the generated assembly code which I used for testing purposes to ensure the functionality
of both files matched. The 2 shell files included simply build and run the disassembler.
