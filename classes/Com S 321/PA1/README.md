### PA1

This was the first 'major' assignment for this class (I say 'major' because it really wasn't that difficult) and required us to write a basic sorting algorithm in C,
and then translate it into assembly using LEGv8. Looking at the code, I used a simple insertion sort which was one of the first sorting algorithms I learned and I
find it to be relatively simple to implement (granted most of the basic sorting algorithms are pretty simple).
