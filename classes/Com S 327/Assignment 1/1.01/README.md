The program currently meets all of the required expectations. However, it does have issues sometimes with getting stuck in a loop, which is currently something I am still in the process of troubleshooting. So far I have narrowed it down to an issue with the path generation. When this happens it will usually terminate itself, but sometimes you may have to terminate it manually (CTRL+C) and run it again. Other than that issue, when ran it will generate and display the map to the console, with every empty space filled with periods (clearings). It generates an exit point on each side and surrounds the rest of the perimeter with boulders (represented by '%'). Additionally, it generates two intersecting paths connecting each exit. It does this with the recursive function <void generatePartialPath(...)> which iterates through each possible next point starting at the exit, until it successfully reaches the target point while staying under a path length specified by <MAX_PATH_LENGTH>. Then, it places both a PokeMart and a PokeCenter in a 2x2 area somewhere adjacent to the path. Finally, it randomly places 2 regions of tall grass on the map, taking care to not override previously generated terrain. The code itself is extremely long, unnecessarily complex, and could use a lot of improvement but for the most part it works and does its job. The program can be run by typing 'make', followed by './assignment-1.01'.
