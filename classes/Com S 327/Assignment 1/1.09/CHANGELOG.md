# CHANGELOG

## May 4th, 2022
- started project
- added basic game UI to display the board w/ coords, the pieces, and the player and opponent status info
- added internal representation of the board and pieces - contained within [chess.h](chess.h) and [chess.cpp](chess.cpp)
- updated UI to include color - added additional aspects to beautify it
- added ability for the player to select and move their pieces
- added ability for CPU to move their pieces using VERY simple & rudimentary 'AI'
- minor bug fixes

## May 8th, 2022
- updated some of the io to look better
- more bug fixes, some more major than others
- halfway implemented display of captured pieces (opponent captures increase when the player captures a piece for some reason)
- began creation of improved ai (not used yet - still relies on old simple one)

## May 9th, 2022
- continued to implement improved ai - did not finish before deadline
