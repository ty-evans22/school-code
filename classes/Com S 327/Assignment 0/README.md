This program conforms to and meets all required assignment specifications. Upon running the program, it will recursively go through each
potential starting cell and output all directed, open knight's tours on a 5 x 5 board. The output meets the assignment requirements and is
formatted correctly, with each tour printed on a separate line and consisting of each cell number appearing exactly once. All 1728 solutions
are printed correctly. The most important function within the program is the <void knightTour> function as it is a recursive function that
effectively does all of the work by finding the solutions. Program can be run by typing 'make' to compile and then running './assignment-0'.
