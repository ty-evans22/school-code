# school-code
A repository containing all of the code from various random projects and assignments I completed during my time at Iowa State University.

**Note: All of the code contained here is uploaded straight from my computer, and I have not tested or modified any of it since when I first wrote it, so some parts
may or may not work. Additionally, all of the code here is mine and mine only (apart from a couple partner assignments that I have done my best to clarify).**
